# How do we work?

Our workflow is to put changes in feature branches which we submit for review
on GitHub as pull requests. Ideally a pull request is small and changes only
one aspect of the code at a time. After a pull request is reviewed by at least
one peer and passes all tests, it can be squash-merged into master.

ðŸ’¡ *We require all commits to be signed for a branch to be merged into
master. Learn more on setting up [commit signing][cs].*

To automate our release process as much as possible we're using
[Standard Version][sv]. Commits on master should be formatted according to
the [conventional commits specification][cc].

Here are a couple of examples:
```
  fix: fix clippy on CI (#430)
  refactor(ui): improve cypress spec reliability (#429)
  style(ui): icon refresh (#411)
  chore(release): 0.0.11 (#417)
  test(ui): add missing project creation specs (#404)
  feat(proxy): improve session (#380)
```

When a release is performed, a section in [CHANGELOG.md][ch] is automatically
generated with all the changes from these commit messages.


## UI

The UI is written in JavaScript, [Svelte][se] is our [component language][cl]
of choice and [Electron][el] wraps it all together into a native desktop
experience. The UI code is split into `/native` and `/ui`.

For dependency management and script execution we use `yarn`. Code formatting
is dictated by [prettier][pr] and linting is provided by [eslint][es]. Both
linting and formatting are enforced locally on a pre-commit basis with
[husky][hu] and [lint-staged][ls].

Additionally we run the same checks as separate build steps on our CI, just to
make sure only properly formatted and lint-free code lands into master.


### Running Upstream

You'll have to install some external dependencies to be able to compile the
proxy as well as the UI.

On macOS:
```
xcode-select --install
sudo xcodebuild -license
brew install yarn pkgconfig nettle
```

On Linux:
  - [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf)
  - [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com)
  - [GMP](https://gmplib.org)
  - [GNU M4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4)
  - [Nettle](http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle)
  - [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org)
  - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

1. Get Upstream: `git clone git@github.com:radicle-dev/radicle-upstream.git`.
2. Install dependencies: `cd radicle-upstream && yarn install`.
3. Start Upstream in development mode: `yarn start`.

Running upstream will create new directories in `XDG_DATA_HOME` &
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (or `HOME` respectiveley). To overwrite the locations, you
can set `RAD_HOME` to your desired directory. Note that you will also have to
set it for using git remote helper functionality outside of upstream.


### Feature flagging

UI features that are experimental or under construction that find their way
into the main branch must be placed behind the feature flag, to make them
inaccessible for the general public.

We do that by using `native > ipc.ts > isExperimental` as a feature flag to
enable or disable said features accordingly to the mode in which we are running
the app.

To start the app with experimental features enabled run:

    RADICLE_UPSTREAM_EXPERIMENTAL=true yarn start

The feature flag is only available in development mode. It is always disabled
in production.


### Running tests

Before running UI end-to-end tests locally you'll need to check out the latest
test fixtures which are included in this repository as a git submodule:

```sh
./scripts/test-setup.sh
```

ðŸ’¡ *You'll have to run the previous commands every time there are any updates
to the test fixture repository.*

We use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for integration tests and
[Jest](jestjs.io) for unit tests. You can find integration tests in the
`cypress/` directory and unit tests next to the modules they correspond to.

- To run all ui tests call: `yarn test`.
- To troubleshoot integration tests via the Cypress GUI, run:
  `yarn test:integration:debug`.
- To isolate a single integration test for debugging purposes, use
  the [`.only` method][on].
- To develop unit tests in watch mode, run: `yarn test:unit:watch`


### Running multiple Upstream instances on the same machine

For testing purposes it is possible to launch multiple Upstream instances at
the same time. At the moment this is only possible in development mode.

```
mkdir /Users/rudolfs/work/19000
mkdir /Users/rudolfs/work/20000

# Launch the first instance.

RAD_HOME="/Users/rudolfs/work/19000" \
RADICLE_UPSTREAM_PROXY_ARGS="--http-listen 127.0.0.1:19000 --peer-listen 0.0.0.0:19000" \
RADICLE_UPSTREAM_UI_ARGS="backend=localhost:19000" \
yarn start

# And then in a separate shell, launch the second instance.

RAD_HOME="/Users/rudolfs/work/20000" \
RADICLE_UPSTREAM_PROXY_ARGS="--http-listen 127.0.0.1:20000 --peer-listen 0.0.0.0:20000" \
RADICLE_UPSTREAM_UI_ARGS="backend=localhost:20000" \
yarn start
```

You can also let the the OS choose a free peer port by setting it to:
`--peer-listen 0.0.0.0:0`. And if you don't need completely isolated state,
then you can use `RAD_PROFILE` instead of `RAD_HOME`, but be aware that
Electron state will be shared by all instances.


### Building an Upstream package for your platform

You can build and package Upstream with: `yarn dist`. The generated package
will be in: `dist/` as `radicle-upstream-X.X.X.{dmg|AppImage}`.


#### Apple notarization

To allow macOS Gatekeeper [to recognise][so] our Upstream packages as genuine,
which allows users to install and open Upstream without unnecessary
[security warnings][sw], we have to [sign and notarize][sn] our macOS packages.

This notarization step is automated using our custom macOS build host for
releases.

However, if the build host is not available, it is possible to set up and
perform notarization locally on Apple hardware.

For this we need:
  - a paid Apple developer account registered to Monadic
  - an Apple ID token for allowing the notarization script to run on behalf of
    our developer account
    - [Account Manage][ma] -> APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORDS -> Generate passwordâ€¦
  - a valid "Developer ID Application" certificate
    - [Certificates Add][ca] -> Developer ID Application
      **Note:** this can only be created via the company account holder

Once you've created the _Developer ID Application_ certificate, download it
locally and add it to your keychain by double clicking on the file.

Before building a notarized DMG, make sure you're connected to the internet and
then run:

```sh
git checkout vX.X.X
CSC_NAME="Monadic GmbH (XXXXXXXXXX)" \
APPLE_ID="XXXXXXX@monadic.xyz" \
APPLE_ID_PASSWORD="XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX" \
NOTARIZE=true \
yarn dist
```

Don't forget to replace the `X` in the template with the real values:
  - `vX.X.X` is the version you'd like to build and notarize
  - `CSC_NAME` is the "Developer ID Application" certificate ID
  - `APPLE_ID` your Apple account ID
  - `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD` your Apple account token that you generated in the
    steps above


### Scripts

To get a list of all available script commands, run: `yarn run`.

**Note:** Scripts marked with `_private` are not meant to be executed from the
the CLI, they're only to be used by other scripts.

Here's a list of all scripts that are intended for developer use:

    yarn start                  # Start Upstream with hot-UI-code-reload
    yarn start:dev              # Start Upstream with hot-UI-code-reload and
                                # run proxy compiled with debug information
    yarn start:test             # Start Upstream with hot-ui-code-reload and
                                # run proxy in test mode with test fixtures

    yarn test                   # Run all UI tests
    yarn test:integration       # Run only Cypress integration tests
    yarn test:integration:debug # Show the Cypress GUI, useful for
                                # visual debugging
    yarn test:unit              # Run only Jest unit tests
    yarn test:unit:watch        # Run Jest tests in watch mode

    yarn dist                   # Build an installable Upstream package for the
                                # current platform

    yarn release                # Start a two-step process to cut a new
                                # release, see DEVELOPMENT.md for more details

    yarn typescript:check       # Type-check all UI *.ts and *.svelte files
    yarn prettier:check         # Check UI code formatting
    yarn prettier:write         # Auto-format UI code
    yarn lint                   # Check UI code for linting errors

    yarn reset:state            # Delete all local state:
                                #   - identity keys
                                #   - monorepo
                                #   - saved preferences

    yarn ethereum:start         # Setup a local ethereum node to which we
                                # deploy the Radicle Contracts and set the
                                # intial balance of a stated local ethereum
                                # development account.

### Design System

The overall look of Upstream is governed by a style guide which is continuously
being improved and extended. This style guide is translated into code forming
the design system. The design system contains all design primitives which, in
turn, can be composed to create rich user experiences.

Most of the components defined by the design system can be conveniently seen on
one page within Upstream by pressing <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>. This will
bring up the Design System Guide modal.

The purpose of the Design System Guide is to showcase all available primitives
and components. Having them all on a single screen allows us to see how changes
to components affect all variations at a glance. Therefore newly created
components should always be added to the Guide, explaining all the different
variations and use cases.


#### File structure

In Svelte everything is a component, so to be able to build a complex
application and still be able to navigate the code and make changes quickly, we
organize our components in groups defined by use-case, re-usability and
complexity. Currently you'll find the following types of components in the
`DesignSystem` directory:

  - `Primitive`: simple, yet highly reusable components like typography,
    buttons, form elements, spacing, positioning and other utilities.

    Components of this type are usually just wrappers around standard HTML
    elements with custom styling.

    There are currently two ways of organizing primitives:

      - as all-in-one components where the type of the component is passed down
        via a `variant` prop. This is for components which have a very similar
        markup, but whose styling differs across variants.  Examples in this
        category are: buttons, typography and positioning helpers.

      - as namespaced components, where the component markup is very different
        across variants, for example: form elements and icons.

    To decide which way to write a new primitive component, start by looking at
    how it's going to be used in code and then optimise for ergonomics.

    All public primitives are exported via a central `index.js` file, which
    makes consumption straightforward:

    ```html
    <script>
      import { Button, Title, Icon, Input } from "../DesignSystem/Primitive";
    </script>

    <Icon.House />
    <Button variant="secondary">OK</Button>
    ```

  - `Component`: reusable low-to-high complexity components.

    Sub-folders in `DesignSystem/Component` should only be created for breaking
    up larger components into smaller fragments. If a component is broken up in
    fragments, make sure to only export the component which is intended for
    public use.

    ```html
    <script>
      import { RadicleLogo } from "../DesignSystem/Component";
    </script>

    <RadicleLogo />
    ```

Next to `DesignSystem`, you'll find a directory called `Screens`. Screens bring
together components from the Design System forming what a user in the UI sees
as a whole screen. More complex screens, similar to components, can be broken
down into multiple fragments. In this case the screen will contain data
fetching and routing logic for the fragments. Fragments should be placed in a
directory named after the screen, like so:

```sh
.
â”œâ”€â”€ RegisterProject                    # fragment directory
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ConfirmTransactionStep.svelte
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ PickNameStep.svelte
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ PickWalletStep.svelte
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ TransactionSummaryStep.svelte
â””â”€â”€ RegisterProject.svelte             # screen
```

Finally, our file and directory naming rules are as follows:

  - Svelte components and directories containing components - PascalCase;
  - everything else, including `*.js` files and folders - camelCase;
  - all folders in `/ui` should be named in singular form as they represent a
    type, not content.


#### Styling

The main entry point of the electron renderer is `public/index.html`. This is
the file where any global styling which is not managed by Svelte should be
imported.

To avoid extra wrappers for positioning and spacing, and to allow style
overrides, components expose a `style` prop:

```html
  <Component style="margin-right: 24px"/>
```


#### Typography

The design system provides a constrained set of typographic styles. This
consists of a set of styled headers, a set of styled paragraphs and a set of
modifiers. These also overlap with the components we have in our design system
in Figma, where the design of the app exists. All classes are prefixed with
`typo-` so this might be helpful if you have any autocomplete in your editor.

For the headers you can just use `<h1>` up to `<h5>`, if you want to apply the
same styles to other html elements you can use the matching classes
`typo-header-1` to `typo-header-5` (use `<h1>` to `<h5>` where you can).

For text we you can use the classes that start with `typo-text`. These come
in 2 sizes, the normal one and `typo-text-small`. Check out
[typography.css](./public/typography.css) to get an idea of the possible
combinations. All the ones we're using in Figma are represented here.

The modifiers give us some flexibility and allow us to create classes for
certain css functionality we use over and over. Such as,
`typo-overflow-ellipsis` and `typo-all-caps`. These should be self-explanatory.

We also added a set of modifiers that allow you to add the font-family as a
class where you need it, here again we would recommend not doing that as most
styles should fit into one of the two categories above.

The only place in the app where we're not using this is in `<Markdown />`,
since the library we use doesn't allow us to overwrite the styles without using
global declarations. If you have any questions or improvements, open an issue
and we're happy to help you along.

#### Colors

The design system supports multiple color palettes via themes which can be
changed in the Settings screen.

Throughout the codebase we use only CSS variables. Raw color codes should not
be used so changes to global styling can be applied in one central place:
`public/colors.css`.

Read more about the colors used in Upstream in the [Color System post][cg].


## Proxy

All of Upstream's business logic tying together the radicle code collaboration
is provided to the UI via an HTTP API by a rust binary called `radicle-proxy`.
It uses [warp][wa] to serve a RESTish JSON API.

For dependency management and execution of common tasks we use [Cargo][co]. To
get up to speed with common functionality and manifest file intricacies consult
the exhaustive [Cargo Book][cb].

The proxy binary's lifecycle is managed by the main renderer of the UI in:
`native/main.ts`. When running `yarn dist` it is bundled together into an
application package by [electron-builder][eb].


### Running the proxy in stand-alone mode

To be able to build the proxy first install all required dependencies from the
[Running Upstream](#running-upstream) section.

To start the proxy binary, run `cargo run`.


### Testing

The proxy and UI share the same test fixtures, if you haven't done it already,
set up the test fixtures like so:

```sh
./scripts/test-setup.sh
```

ðŸ’¡ *You'll have to run the command every time there are any updates to the test
fixture repository.*

Then run tests as usual: `cargo test --all-features --all-targets`.

We strive for two kinds of tests: classic unit tests contained in
implementation files and integration tests. The integration tests are meant to
assert correctness of the API provided by the proxy, these can be found under
`proxy/tests`. To find out where to place and how to lay out tests, check the
Rust book [test chapter][rt].


### File structure

The API exposes the application's domain logic. Therefore we try to treat it as
a thin layer exposing well-typed entities. The heavy lifting is done in the
modules named after the protocols we consume - [radicle-link][rl] through it
[radicle-surf][rs], for code collaboration. By isolating concerns this way, we
hope to enable ease-of-contribution to downstream teams. Empowering them to
reflect changes in their public APIs easily with code contributions to
Upstream.


## CI setup

Our CI infrastructure runs on [Buildkite][bk]. The build process is run for
every commit which is pushed to GitHub. When tests pass, the build process
uploads the Upstream binary as a build artifact. If the UI end-to-end tests
fail, screenshots of the failing tests are uploaded instead of the binary.

All relevant configuration can be found here:

```sh
radicle-upstream/.buildkite
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ pipeline.yaml
â””â”€â”€ run.sh
```


### Docker image updates

We use a Docker image with all system dependencies pre-installed to reduce
build times. If you need to update this image, proceed as follows:

1. Install [Google Cloud SDK][gc].

2. Authenticate with Google Cloud: `gcloud auth configure-docker`, pick
   `[1] opensourcecoin` when asked for which project to use.

3. Prepare a new docker image with all the necessary dependencies by editing:
   `.buildkite/Dockerfile`.

4. Get the current image version from `pipeline.yaml` and build a new Docker
   image (remember to bump the version):

    ```sh
    cd .buildkite
    docker build . -t gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-upstream:0.2.1
    ```

5. Push the new image version to Google Cloud:

   `docker push gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-upstream:0.2.1`

6. Update the image version in `pipeline.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   DOCKER_IMAGE: 'gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-upstream:0.2.1'
   ```

7. Commit changes to `Dockerfile` and `pipeline.yaml`. Pushing the changes will
   create a new branch and build the updated image.

## Releases
### Prerequisites
#### Google Cloud CLI

For uploading artifacts to releases.radicle.xyz, you'll need a working `gcloud`
environment. To do so, follow points 1 and 2 from the
[Docker image updates][do] section.


#### GitHub `hub` CLI tool

Please install the [`hub`][hb] CLI tool (version >= **2.14**), we use it in our
release automation script to:

  - create a pull-request off of a release branch;
  - to merge the release branch into master;
  - to close the pull-request.

Then you'll have to create a _Personal access token_ for it in the
[GitHub Developer settings][gt] page and authenticate the CLI tool once
by running any command that does a request to GitHub, like so: `hub api`.
You'll be asked to provide your GitHub login and the access token.


### Publishing a release

To perform a release run: `git checkout master && yarn release` and follow the
instructions.
